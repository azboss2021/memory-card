# Memory Card Project

## A basic Memory Card game that lets you test your memory with constantly shuffling cards. Try not to click a card twice!

This project was built while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The app is functional, yet extremely simple. Try out the demo below.
